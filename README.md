# Time-Series-Analysis-for-Transportation

### ****Business Task****

The **22nd Century Sporting League** aims to optimize transportation logistics for the **2102 season** by determining the **minimum number of jets** required and calculating the **total fuel cost** based on forecasted fuel prices.

### ****Method****

1. **Analyze Flight Data**:
   * Calculate flight durations, distances, and fuel consumption using team\_flights.csv.
   * Optimize jet usage to minimize the number of jets needed.
2. **Forecast Fuel Prices**:
   * Use historical fuel price data (fuel\_price.csv) to predict 2102 prices using a time series model (SARIMAX).
3. **Calculate Fuel Costs**:
   * Merge forecasted fuel prices with flight data to compute total fuel spend.
4. **Visualize Results**:
   * Plot historical and forecasted fuel prices to validate the model.

### ****Outcome****

1. **Number of Jets Required**: Minimum jets needed for the season.
2. **Total Fuel Cost**: Projected fuel expenses for 2102.
3. **Fuel Price Forecast**: Visualization of historical and forecasted fuel prices.
